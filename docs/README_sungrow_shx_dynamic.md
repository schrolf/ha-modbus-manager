### 🔄 Automatic Filtering

#### **Phase Filtering**
- **1-phase:** Only Phase A registers are loaded
- **3-phase:** All Phase A, B, C registers are loaded

#### **MPPT Filtering**
- **MPPT 1:** Only MPPT1 registers
- **MPPT 2:** MPPT1 + MPPT2 registers
- **MPPT 3:** All MPPT1, MPPT2, MPPT3 registers

#### **Battery Filtering**
- **Battery none:** Battery-dependent entities are filtered out
- **Battery standard_battery:** Inverter battery registers only (slave 1) — available on **LAN and WiNet-S**
- **Battery sbr_battery:** Inverter battery registers + separate SBR/SBH template (slave 200) — **LAN only**

#### **Meter Type Filtering**
- **None:** No meter registers (5740-5745)
- **Internal:** Inverter is installed as full backup and no dedicated meter is installed
- **DTSU666:** Standard single-channel meter (registers 5600-5606)
- **DTSU666-20:** Dual-channel meter with Channel 2 support (registers 5600-5606 + 13199-13205)
- **Note:** iHomeManager is now a separate template (`sungrow_ihomemanager.yaml`) and should not be selected here

#### **Connection Filtering**
- **LAN:** All registers available (including extended statistics and SBR via slave 200)
- **WINET:** Extended statistical registers not available; use **`standard_battery`** for inverter-side battery sensors and controls (not SBR/slave 200)

#### **Firmware Adaptation**
- Automatic sensor parameter adjustment based on firmware version
- Support for different data formats between firmware versions

### 📶 WiNet-S connection notes

Use **Connection: WINET** when Modbus TCP goes through the **WiNet-S** dongle (not a LAN/Modbus TCP gateway).

#### Initial setup (battery present)
- Select **WINET** as connection type during device options.
- If a battery is configured, initial setup offers **`standard_battery`** automatically (inverter slave **1** registers and controls).
- The **SBR / slave 200** wizard is **skipped** on WiNet-S — SBR is **LAN-only**.
- On **Reconfigure Device**, **`battery_config`** is limited to **`none`** or **`standard_battery`** on WiNet-S (`sbr_battery` is clamped).

#### Expected entity count
- A hybrid such as **SH10RT** with **WiNet-S** and **`standard_battery`** typically creates about **165–180** entities (template sensors/controls + calculated/binary sensors).
- LAN-only statistics are excluded when **`connection_type`** is **WINET** — a high count is **normal**, not a misconfiguration.

#### `connection_type` persistence
- **`connection_type`** is stored on the **device record** and used for entity filtering.
- **Reconfigure Device** falls back to the hub-level value when needed, so **WiNet-S** is not shown as **LAN** after setup.

#### Known WiNet-S log noise
- Sporadic Modbus **“extra data”** or similar transport warnings can appear on WiNet-S paths.
- These are a **known limitation of the WiNet TCP bridge**, not something the integration can fully suppress.
- If reads/writes still work, the messages can usually be ignored.

### 🔧 Hub communication (LAN and WiNet-S)

These settings apply to the **Modbus hub** (initial connection step, **Hub Options**, or hub **Reconfigure**). They affect all devices on that hub, including SHx.

| Setting | Default | Range | Purpose |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Wait between Requests** (`message_wait_milliseconds`) | 100 ms | 10–1000 ms | Pause between Modbus read/write requests on the bus |
| **Delay after Control Writes** (`post_write_settle_milliseconds`) | 500 ms | 0–5000 ms (`0` = off) | Pause after a control write before the next Modbus IO |

**WiNet-S tuning tips:**
- Start with defaults; increase **`post_write_settle_milliseconds`** to **1000** or higher if controls briefly flicker **`unavailable`** or reads race with writes.
- Existing hubs **without** `post_write_settle_milliseconds` keep automatic settle (**500 ms** LAN / **1000 ms** WiNet-S) until you set the option explicitly.
- Very low **`message_wait_milliseconds`** on WiNet-S can increase errors when many entities poll — **100 ms** is a sensible starting point.

### ⏱️ Control response timing (writes)

After you change a **select**, **number**, **switch**, or similar control:

1. The integration **writes** the holding register (serialized with other Modbus IO).
2. A **post-write settle** delay runs (hub setting or automatic LAN/WiNet default).
3. The **written register is read back immediately** (does not wait for its normal `scan_interval`).
4. Entities listening on that register update via coordinator listeners.

**Typical UI update:** about **1–2 seconds** after a successful write.

**If it takes longer:** the inverter may not yet reflect the new value in the register (device-side delay). The state history shows when Home Assistant **read back** the new value, not necessarily the exact moment you clicked.

Examples: **EMS Mode Selection** (register 13049), export limits, battery forced charge/discharge controls.

### 📈 PV Analysis & Performance Metrics

#### Self-Consumption & Autarky
Formulas follow standard definitions: daily-basis for short-term PV efficiency analysis.

**Current (real-time)** – power-based, instant snapshot:
- **Self-Consumption Rate** – % of PV power consumed directly (not exported)
- **Autarky Rate** – % of load supplied by PV/Battery
- **Grid Dependency** – % of load from grid (inverse of autarky)

**Today (daily)** – energy-based, standard formulas:
- **Self-Consumption Rate (Today)** – (Direct + PV→Battery) / PV Generation × 100
  *"Which share of generated solar is used directly or stored?"*
- **Autarky Rate (Today)** – (Direct + Battery discharge) / Total consumption × 100
  *"Which share of consumed power comes from own production (incl. storage)?"*
- **self_consumption_of_today** – inverter register (13029), may differ from calculated value

#### Energy Flow Analysis
Priority logic reflects physical inverter behavior: Grid supplies load first (AC path); only remainder charges battery (AC→DC). PV (DC) charges battery before grid when both available.

- **PV to Load Direct** - PV power going directly to load (without battery)
- **PV to Battery** - PV (DC) charging battery; grid charges only after load supplied
- **Grid to Battery** - Grid power charging battery; only after load deficit covered (AC→DC)
- **Battery to Load** - Battery power to load (excludes battery export)
- **PV to Grid** - PV excess exported to grid (excludes battery export)
- **Battery to Grid** - Battery power exported to grid (e.g. VPP, feed-in)
- **Grid to Load** - Grid power to load (priority when importing)
- **Net Consumption** - Net consumption after PV and battery supply

#### MPPT Performance Analysis
- **MPPT Deviation from Average** - Maximum deviation (W) from average MPPT power; indicates string imbalance. 0 W when balanced.
- **MPPT Balance** - 100% when all strings are balanced; lower when one string underperforms.
- **Active MPPT Count** - Number of MPPT channels with power > 10 W (useful for 4-MPPT inverters with fewer strings).

#### PV System Performance
- **PV Capacity Factor** - Current PV power as percentage of inverter rated capacity
- **PV Generation Hours Today** - Equivalent generation hours at current power level (approximation)
